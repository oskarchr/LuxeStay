LuxeStay is a mobile-first web application built with Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind.css. It utilizes Supabase for authentication and database management. The app is inspired by AirBnB, offering a luxurious setting and follows a design created in a group assignment using Figma.
The landing page displays all listings with a search bar and additional filtering options for easy navigation. The details page provides comprehensive information for each listing, including a map powered by the Google Maps API. When logged in, users can make bookings, view booking summaries, and receive confirmations once the booking is finalized in the database. The page also displays average ratings and reviews from other users.
On the favorites page, users can view all their favorite listings, which can be marked as favorites directly from the landing or details page. The trips page shows both upcoming and past bookings, with detailed information and the option to cancel upcoming bookings. Users can also leave reviews for past trips.
The profile page allows users to sign out, change account settings, and access the terms and policy of the application.
